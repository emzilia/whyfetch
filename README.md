### Dependencies:
gcc  
  
## Install  
Extract the directory somewhere. Then, within that directory, run the following commands:  
```
make  
make install  
```
Running ```make``` compiles the C program binary, then ```make install``` copies the binary into your ~/.local/bin so you can execute it within your terminal. 


## Uninstall
To remove the binary from your system, run the following command from within the program directory:  
```
make uninstall
```
